#Week-01-Challenge

##User Story

Clean up the code while allowing the website to maintain its look and functionality.

##Solution

Combine CSS classes that have the same elements such as with the H2 from the search-engine-optimization h2, online-reputation-management h2 and social-media-marketing h2 classes. 
Doing this keeps the look of the website the same while removing a lot of unnecessary code.
